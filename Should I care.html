	Should I care?
	</h2>
	<p>Artists and producers go through a lot to provide the public with their art. From the creative processes one has to go through in order to deliver a product that is worth being played on the radio is still an objective for most artists. So, for streaming services, which is the number 1 outlet that people use to stream music, to pay 0.00163 per stream is not only insulting but much lower than what they have to give. Even though artists can decide if they want their music on streaming platforms, they will eventually cave in. An example would be Chance the rapper. An American Rapper from Chicago who made headway in the music industry with mixtapes submitted to Soundcloud, who pays up to 0.004 per stream, who had a core audience and was respected as an independent artist. His first mixtape titled “10 day” has been streamed as of 12/7/20 over 76 million times on Soundcloud. “10 day” was released in 2013 and ushered in a new era for independent artist to use Soundcloud to showcase their art. For his first full length project in 2016, he released the project “Coloring Book” to the masses on Spotify and Apple music. We can assume he made such a transition due to multiple factors of streaming. For example, you must maximize your audience. Meaning that you cannot have all of your content on one streaming platform. You cannot rely on platforms that allow users to listen to music for free, such as Spotify or Soundcloud. You need a money first company like Apple Music in order to maximize your audience. Chance the rappers switch to being solely on Soundcloud to promoting to the masses is one of the problems with streaming in general. Why can’t an artist have longevity on one platform? In the older days, CDs and Cassette tapes evened the playing field in terms of distribution to the masses, along with radio that can have your song broadcasted nationally. You should care because if you have ever worked at a minimum wage job, you understand how hard it is to live off $9 an hour. So to exclusively live off your music is almost impossible due to the main outlet in which you can showcase your art has such low payments per stream that you can’t live a reasonable life off music.
